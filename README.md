# luuk180.dev Version 2
This is version 2 of my personal portfolio.
The old version was built in angular and it is very hard to deploy and to keep up to date.
So I decided to rebuild it. This version is being built in Vue with hosting on AWS Amplify.
The cloud functions should be faster than on Firebase and it is very comparable otherwise.
You can expect to see this version deployed to my domain in a week or so.
